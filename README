1. To add new posts, go to http://<your-appid>.appspot.com/new
2. To edit an existing post go to http://<your-appid>.appspot.com/?i=<post_id>&e=1, where <post_id> is the content_id of your post
3. The c param defines the category of the post. For ex, all posts under code category will be available at http://<your-appid>.appspot.com/?c=code
Talk to ujjwalgrover@gmail.com in case you have any doubts setting all this up.

LIMITATIONS/TODO probably for v 1.1
1. You cannot delete a post once it is published
2. No search -- need to do some workarounds since theres no 'like' like database lookup
3. No tag based search/lookup -- easy. and boring. 
4. Need to implement link-blog-posts ideas.
